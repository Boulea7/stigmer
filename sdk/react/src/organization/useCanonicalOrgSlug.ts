 * built from a stored `metadata.org`) or a slug the organization has since
 * been renamed away from (old slugs keep resolving for a while). Pages
 * work either way, since the server accepts both; this hook tells the
 * host which slug to replace the segment with so the address bar reads
 * the organization's current name. Navigation stays the host's: it
 * replaces the URL itself.

 * Answers the slug a URL's org segment should read, or `null` when the

 *
 * - A segment equal to one of the person's organizations' current slugs
 *   is canonical: `null`, with no request.
 * - A segment equal to one of their organizations' ids answers that
 *   organization's slug, with no request.
 * - Any other segment is looked up once (the server resolves an id or an
 *   old slug to the organization); its slug is answered when it differs.
 *   A lookup the server refuses answers `null`.
 *
 * Waits for {@link OrgProvider}'s list to load, and answers `null` when no
 * provider is mounted.
 *
 * @param orgSegment - The org segment of the current URL, or `""`/`null`
 *   when the URL has none.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * const canonical = useCanonicalOrgSlug(params.org);
 * useEffect(() => {
 *   if (canonical) navigate(`/library/agents/${canonical}/${params.slug}`, { replace: true });
 * }, [canonical]);
