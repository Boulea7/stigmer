/**
 * Test fixtures for the Organization domain, shared by every composed
 * suite that writes into an Organization: `organizationInput` is the
 * smallest create the chain accepts, and `seedOrganizations` creates each
 * named Organization through the server's own create RPC, so the rows are
 * exactly what a person's first create writes: the server mints each id
 * (org_<ulid>) and keeps the slug as the organization's name
 * (domain/organization/steps.ts). It answers each slug's minted id, which
 * a suite uses wherever a value is stored, compared with stored data,
 * passed in-process or written straight to the store; a serving request
 * may still name the organization by slug, since the serving chain
 * resolves it (pipeline/interceptors/organization-names.ts).
 *
 * Why every such suite needs it: every org-scoped lane authorizes on the
 * Organization it names, and under every posture a missing one answers
 * NOT_FOUND before any other step (the trusted-local driver since
 * stigmer#1163, authorization/trusted-local-authorizer.ts). A suite that
 * writes under a slug nobody created is testing the phantom write that
 * fix removed, so it seeds the slugs it uses in its `beforeAll`, once the
 * server listens. A slug a test means to be absent is simply not seeded.
